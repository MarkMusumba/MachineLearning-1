Implementation of Machine learning Classification Algorithms such as :
  Naive Bayes
  K - Nearest Neighbours
  Support Vector Machines - Using different Kernel tricks such as Polynomial, Radial, Linear, Sigmoid.
in Python. The algorithm runs for 10 times with different samples of data and also using 90% of data for testing and 10% for validation.

It also contains a data analytics performed on the same dataset in python and providing a data visualization for the same by the independent variables and attributes.

The dataset is named as Pima dataset. More description about this dataset can be obtained here:
